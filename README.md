  2. Core Concepts - Key concepts and terminology
  3. Common Commands/Patterns - The most frequently used commands or patterns
  4. Examples - Practical examples with explanations

  Format the content with clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points.
  Include code examples where appropriate.
  Make the content concise but comprehensive.
  
  Return the content in markdown format.
`;
